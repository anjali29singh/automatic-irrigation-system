# automatic-irrigation-system

## Introduction

This is an automatic irrigation system that uses a soil moisture sensor to detect the moisture level and turn on the water pump when the moisture level is below a certain threshold. When it crosses the threshold is automatically stops the water pump.

## Components Required

1. YL-69 Soil Moisture Sensor
2. 8051 microcontroller - ATMEGA328-PU (IC)
3. 16 x 2 LCD Display
4. Motor Pump
5. Signal channel relay
6. ADC
7. power supply , resistors , capacitors , breadboard, connecting wires

## Software used

I have used Keil uVision5 for writing the code and flashing it to the microcontroller.
